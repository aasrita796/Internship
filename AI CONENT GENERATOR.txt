llm which makes tweets 

we are extracting data from twitter via tweepy and then using gemini to analyze that data to make our llm

20th August 2025
Using Gemini to execute prompts => (how to execute ai prompts in our python program)

21st August 2025
Do sentiment analysis on the tweets

23rd August 2025
Fine tuning: when you want to speak a llm in a such a way (you can make llm that speaks like trump)

25th August 2025
Dumping tweets to json file

26th August 2025
Dumping 50 tweets to json file

27th August 2025
Refined training data
Specialized/Nichce LLM

FOR EMOJIS : with open("extracted_tweets.json", encoding="utf-8") as extracted_tweets_file:

2nd September 2025

inputs:
top 5 first ==> from engagement type and analyzed_tweets.json (dict)
prompt (str)
both sit into the system prompt and sent to custom llm

2 posts and which will perform more
A/B testing

sir, we are doing AB testing, where tweet A and tweet B are generated and those two tweets are compared with each other and the output tells which tweet performs better and also the explanation for it.

Create a llm/ai which creates tweets for us 
AI ops
took models and made 2 tweets out of 2 models
1 model to make tweet a, another model to make tweet b, another model to compare both tweets

ml ops

We are giving top5 tweets, tweet a and tweet b then we are getting ta vs tb prediction and explanation as output. 

frontend : flask
backend = business logic + connection to frontend

17th September

interface b/w browerser and pgm
sending data from frontend to backend:
via url
via post request
?: asking qtn to url
cors policy = frontend and backend should have same orgin

//MOCK PRESENTATION STEPS

Step 1: (tweet extraction ==> we need twitter developer account for it) Used Tweepy to fetch tweets from a tech company via the Twitter API (extracted_tweets.json).

Step 2: sentiment_analysis ==> (we analysed tweets ==> likes, retweet count, reply count, sentiment score, engagement score. we asked it to do engagement analysis (why this tweet performs well?)) Performed sentiment analysis on those tweets using the Gemini API (analyzed_tweets.json).

Step 3: Selected the top 5 tweets based on engagement score.

Step 4: Used Gemini API to generate 2 new tweets, compared them, and predicted which would perform better (with explanation).

Step 5: Built a Flask backend to take a prompt, generate tweets, and provide prediction/explanation.

Step 6: Created a UI for user engagement.

runPrompt send prompt to backend and generate results

aim: create an ai content marketing optimizer 

what is unique? : we extracted tweets from niche industries (amazon, flipkart) similar industry we can sell to them, chatgpt is generalized but my tweet is trained for niche (our llm model is niche model that is for marketing trained on the industries you're targeting) target industry ==> xiaomi (consumer electronics market), amazon (ecommerce) 

error 500 ==> backend prb
error 404 ==> page not found
24th sep:
send anal. tweets to llm that got converted to speacialaised llm/niche llm (not general llm) create better posts because of training data

step 1+2 ==> training data extraction
i/p twitter api & handle
o/p tweet analysis, analyzed_tweets.json

step 3 (gemini - flash - lite - 2.5 model) ==> building the llm ==> select top 5 tweets from analysed tweets

system prompt ==> user prompt + content + instructions

system prompt is combined with base llm (gemini) 

25th sep
extract tweets and give it to llm and ask for a sentiment score
system prompt ==> context = our tweet(analysed tweets), instruction = how we want 
now we have specialasied llm

phase 3: same niche llm used to create 2 tweets 
writing another prompt for comparing the A,B tweets for AB testing and getting a prediction of which tweet will do better
sending A, B tweets to another llm for prediction 
flask is basically a interface for create_tweet.py and index.html

26th sep:

INTERACTING W LLM:
whenever we want to interact with llm we use prompt

WHY SELECTING ONLY TOP 5 TWEETS?:
phase 2 ==> instead of sending 50 tweets inside llm we sent only 5 tweets  because there is token limit (single shot model) another reason : instead of sending llm low engagement tweet we give less amount of data by selecting top 5 tweets.

aim: creating a tool for marketing people/ to create a niche LLM for tweet generation.
for company
what is demographic, who will use this for what
a better way to promote an existing product
how ? our ai learns the patterns on the previous successful tweets and trains from it for our niche case
which llm: gemini based models, flask
